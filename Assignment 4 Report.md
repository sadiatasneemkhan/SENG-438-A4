# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
## Selenium

Advantages:
- User-friendly interface, simple and very easy to use
- Allows you to replay the sequence of steps of the test script

Disadvantages:
- Slow performance and caused webpages to become unresponsive

## Sikulix

Advantages
- Image recognition makes it easy to test specific elements of a webpage
- Automates flash objects, while Selenium does not

Disadvantages:
- Having to manually write the test scripts
- User interface is not as friendly as Selenium
